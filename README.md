# AquaLens_V1
AquaLens is a robust monitoring system for tracking, identifying and re-identifying fish for individual evaluation of their overall health and condition. It can track all the fish in the tank over their lifetime while working relatively well on lightweight systems.
The system has been designed and developed for fish detection, tracking, identification, and re-identification to have complete and concise information of the fish in the tank that will be used for precise monitoring.
